## üõ†Ô∏è Developing Locally

Interested in contributing or running Kyoku Wallet from the source? Here‚Äôs how:

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/kyoku-labs/kyoku-wallet.git](https://github.com/kyoku-labs/kyoku-wallet.git)
cd kyoku-wallet
Install Dependencies
We use npm for package management as defined in our scripts.

Bash

npm install
Environment Variables
Kyoku Wallet requires API keys for certain services (like Helius for enhanced NFT/token data and ExchangeRate-API for currency conversion).

Create a .env file in the root of the project by copying the example (if you create one) or creating it manually:
Bash

# .env
VITE_HELIUS_API_KEY="YOUR_HELIUS_API_KEY"
VITE_EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY="YOUR_EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY"
Replace "YOUR_HELIUS_API_KEY" and "YOUR_EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY" with your actual API keys.
Get a Helius API key from Helius.dev.
Get an ExchangeRate-API key from ExchangeRate-API.com.
Note: For tests, these variables are mocked in jest.setup.js.

Build for Production/Development
Production build (minified, no sourcemaps):
Bash

npm run build
Development build (unminified, with inline sourcemaps for easier debugging):
Bash

npm run build:dev
Files will be output to the dist/ directory.
Start Development Server (with Hot Reloading for UI)
This command starts the Vite development server, which is useful for working on the UI components (like popup, onboarding, confirmation pages) with hot reloading. Note that for testing the full extension functionality (background scripts, content scripts), you'll need to load the built extension into Chrome.

Bash

npm run dev
This typically serves the main popup UI (index.html) on http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is busy).

Running Tests
Execute the Jest test suite:

Bash

npm run test
To run tests in watch mode:

Bash

npm run test:watch
Install the Development Version of the Extension
Run npm run build:dev to create a development build in the dist folder.
Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.
Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right).
Click "Load unpacked."
Select the dist folder from your kyoku-wallet project directory.
Kyoku Wallet should now appear in your extensions list and browser toolbar.
If you make changes to the source code, you'll need to run npm run build:dev again and then click the "reload" button for the extension in chrome://extensions for the changes to take effect in the background and content scripts. UI pages might hot-reload if you are also running npm run dev and have opened them directly in your browser, but for the actual extension popup, a reload in chrome://extensions is often needed.
